# Contributing

[Andmore](https://www.eclipse.org/andmore) is a fork of the former MOTODEV Studio and Android Development Tools plugins for eclipse.
The goal is to enhance the Google ADT plugins to provide additional features and functionality that ADT currently
does not provide.

This is an open source community lead project, so contributions are encouraged.  All code contributions will
be licensed under an Eclipse Public License.

To get started, <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/legal/clafaq.php">sign the Contributor License Agreement</a>.  You need to have a CLA on file with the Eclipse Foundation.

## Commit Message Format

The Eclipse Foundation requires that git commit messages follow particular format.  An example is as follows:

    [410937] Auto share multiple projects in single job
    
    When multiple projects are imported together, perform all the necessary
    auto shares in a single job rather than spawning a separate job for each
    project.
    
    Bug: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=410937
    Also-by: Some Otherperson <otherperson@someplace.net>
    Signed-off-by: Joe Somebody <somebody@someplace.net>

Andmore contains a template that should be enabled on your forks to provide the template.   This is located in the templates directory.

To configure git to use this template for all commit messages do the following:

    git config commit.template ./templates/commit.template

This will provide the following information for you to fill out:

    [bugnumber] Summary Description
    
    Detail Description here about the commit.
    
    Bug: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=bugnumber
    Signed-off-by: Joe Somebody <somebody@someplace.net>

All commits need to reference an existing Bugzilla number.  Any pull request that does not reference a bugzilla number won't be merged until a bugzilla is filed.  You can file new bugs and feature requests at
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=andmore

Please make sure that your CLA is signed with the Eclipse Foundation, and that your commits are authored by the same email address as you referenced in your CLA.

You can change your default user.email address for the git repository:

     git config user.email youremail@someplace.com


The following describes how to build Andmore and bring the source code into an existing eclipse environment to development and improve.

# Building from the Command Line

To compile.  You need Maven 3.x installed. Once Maven has been installed, you are ready 
to build.  Use the command:

    mvn clean install

Running the above will compile all features and plugins.  It will also generate a p2 update
site that can be used to install the plugins into your own Eclipse installation.

The site location is:

_andmore-core/site/target/repository_

You can add this as a local repository for Eclipse to install from.

If you want to build a complete product, then use the following command:

    mvn clean install -Pproduct

This will also build all supported platform versions of the full IDE as well.  These can be found in the directory 

_andmore-core/site/target/products_

Windows, MacOSX, and Linux builds are available.

# Building from Eclipse

To build from Eclipse, use the Eclipse SDK. You will need to add the m2e plugins after the
SDK is installed.  Java 1.7 or 1.8 are supported.

1. Choose _File>Import>Maven>Existing Maven Projects_
1. Choose the pom.xml in the root directory of Andmore project
1. When the projects are imported, there will be some errors. Ignore them for now.
1. Choose _Preferences>Plug-in Development>Target Platform_
1. Choose the target that ends with andmore.target. If there are other Andmore targets with different names, ignore them.
1. There will be some sub-projects that do not need to be in the workspace. They will have compile errors because they are for a different OS than you are using. It is alright to close them in Eclipse, but don't delete them from the filesystem as the Maven build compiles them properly.
1. Create a run configuration. You will probably need to add *-XX:MaxPermSize=256m* or higher to the VM Arguments setting on the Arguments tab.

## Project set

There is a project set that can be imported as an alternative to using Maven. This file
is in android-core/plugins/org.eclipse.andmore/projectSet.psf.  The project set file is
not guaranteed to be always updated, so if dependency issues arise, use the Maven import.
